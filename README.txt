A mod made for Spooky Jam 2022 adding in a new dangerous and mob filled cursed crypt structure, ridden with cursed claws, where you can find yourself a wand to summon some spooky skeletal hands to trap mobs for you!

#**Cursed Crypt**
A structure with a few skeletal mobs lurking inside. Watch out for cursed claws on the ground, and break the claw in the final room to get yourself a cursed wand.

#**Cursed Wand**
Right-click with the wand on block surfaces to place cursed claws atop them. It's durability doesn't last too long, though it can easily be repaired with bone blocks!
